## Introduction
Hello and welcome to Paw-ism a game where you play as an evil cat Larry! Your objective? Collect mices while avoiding the cleaning ladies trying to kick you out! After capturing the mice sacrifice enough of them to summon your evil cat god back into the world!

This game was made by 7 people during a 2 day game jam.
